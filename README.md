# Hi there 👋

I'm **Sebastian Urrea**, Software Developer at **Caseware** 🚀

---

During my studies, I worked in several fields such as Computer Vision, Data Analytics and Software Development. I did some cool stuff with schedule planning and linear optimization techniques for students at my uni. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Caseware, with technologies such as Angular, Spring, NestJS, GraphQL and others!

I love learning! I'm currently interested in improving my skills in Flutter and Rust through my personal projects 💡

I'm from Colombia 🇨🇴 but I consider myself a citizen of the world 🌎

You can contact me by email: `js.urrea [at] uniandes.edu.co`
